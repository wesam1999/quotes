# quotes
Use the file recent-quotes.json to show random popular book quotes.<br />
Your program should use GSON to parse the .<br />
json file. The app needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run.<br /> 
The app should choose one quote each time it is run.<br />
like :<br />
```
author :""
"tags": [
"attributed-no-source"
],
"author": "Marilyn Monroe",
"likes": "18651 likes",
```
"text": "I am good, but not an angel. I do sin, but I am not the devil.<br />
I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love."<br />
and print it .<br />
